This repository is for Hacklab's bylaws. By making it a git repository, we hope to facilitate more complicated ammendements.

Pull requests to the master branch of hacklabto's github repository for this will only be merged in compliance with Amendments (1): "These by-laws may be amended by a two-third vote of
members present at any Annual or Special member meeting..."

The [http://wiki.hacklab.to/index.php?title=Bylaws Hacklab's wiki article] remains the canonical version and official reference for our bylaws.

Hacklab's Anti-Harassment Policy is also included in this repository since it was adopted into the bylaws as of Meeting-2010-06-20-AGM.
