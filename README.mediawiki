This repository is for Hacklab's bylaws. By making it a git repository, we hope to facilitate more complicated amendments.

Pull requests to the master branch of hacklabto's github repository for this will only be merged in compliance with [https://github.com/hacklabto/hacklab-bylaws/blob/master/Bylaws.mediawiki#amendments Amendments] (1): "These by-laws may be amended by a two-third vote of
members present at any Annual or Special member meeting..." Please make proposed amendments as branches in your personal repository and submit a pull request for consideration at the next AGM.

The [http://wiki.hacklab.to/index.php?title=Bylaws Hacklab's wiki article] remains the canonical version and official reference for our bylaws.

Hacklab's Anti-Harassment Policy is also included in this repository since it was adopted into the bylaws as of [http://wiki.hacklab.to/index.php?title=Meeting-2010-06-20-AGM Meeting-2010-06-20-AGM].
